# Introduction

Welcome to the Portify Client API. This is a private API reserved only for use by Portify's partner organisations, not end-users of the Portify service.

Portify provides a web-based dashboard to it's partner organisations. The same endpoints that power that dashboard are available here as a RESTful API.

To be able to use this API, you must have had an Admin account set up for you by the Portify team, and received your email and password.
